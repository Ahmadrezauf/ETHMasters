\section*{Clustering}
\subsection*{k-means}

$\hat{R}(\mu) = \sum_{i=1}^n \underset{j\in\{1,...k\}}{\operatorname{min}}||x_i-\mu_j||_2^2$\\
$\hat{\mu} =  \underset{\mu}{\operatorname{argmin}} ~ \hat{R}(\mu)$ ...non-convex, NP-hard \\
Algorithm (Lloyd's heuristic): Choose starting centers, assign points to closest \emph{center}, update centers to mean of each cluster, repeat. It always converges ($\mathbb{O}(nkd)$) even though could be exponentially.
Can't use cross-validation to determine $\#$clusters. What to use? Prior knowledge, Elbow, Regularization. 

\subsection*{k-means++}
Have samples from the clusters that you don't have sample yet, and sample more from the big classes. Sample points proportionally to the squared distance to the closest selected center. 
Expected cost is $\mathbb{O}(log k)$ times that of optimal K-means solution.
